# Python-api-Challenge

The `WeatherPy` directory contains 2 Jupyter Source Files `WeatherPy.ipynb` and `VacationPy.ipynb` which request relevant data from 2 API providers **OpenWeatherMap** and **Geoapify** for over 500 cities within the desired coordinates, and a repo `output_data` which contains the output images generated from `WeatherPy.ipynb`.
